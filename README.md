# 🚀 DSA0toHero: Your Structured Guide to Mastering DSA

Starting your journey with **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** can feel overwhelming—not because of a lack of resources, but because of an **abundance of sources**. It’s easy to get lost. That’s why I created **DSA0toHero**: a structured and curated repository to guide you step by step. 

Each folder in this repo represents a specific **chapter** of DSA, complete with:  
- 📜 **Questions as comments** alongside solutions in code files.  
- 📂 **PDFs with notes** on syntax, operations, or topic-specific explanations.  

These are not random questions—they are **must-do problems** that build a solid foundation for the respective topic. This repository is incredibly valuable, so don’t forget to share it with your friends too! 🌟

## 🏁 Before You Start

To get the most out of this journey, I recommend completing these two important steps:

### 1️⃣ Learn a Programming Language  
Before diving into tricky and technical questions on platforms like LeetCode, make sure you’re **fluent in a programming language**. Coding should feel like a conversation between you and the problem.  
- **For me, it was C++!** Check the **Fundamentals** folder for essential C++ resources to help you get started.  
- Choose a language you’re comfortable with and ensure you’ve mastered its basics.  

### 2️⃣ Build Willpower and Consistency  
DSA requires **dedication**. It’s not about rushing through problems; it’s about solving them consistently. Make a plan, stick to it, and keep going—even when it gets tough!
