Welcome to my DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) journey! This repository documents how I am solving problems daily and improving step by step.

Why This Journey?
Starting DSA felt overwhelming, and I struggled with the fear of not being able to solve problems. I realized that my biggest mistake was diving into problems without building a strong foundation. Here's how I overcame this:

Strengthening Fundamentals:

Focused on mastering a programming language first (for me, itâ€™s C++ ðŸ’ª).

Structured Learning:

Followed Striverâ€™s DSA Sheet, a well-organized guide for learning and practicing DSA systematically.

Whatâ€™s Inside?

This repository contains:

ðŸŒŸ Daily Problem-Solving Logs: Solutions and explanations for the problems I solve every day.

ðŸ“š Fundamental Concepts: Notes and examples that helped me build a strong base in DSA.

ðŸŽ¯ My growth from being a DSA beginner to becoming a confident problem solver.

Goals of This Repository

Inspire others who are starting their DSA journey.
Share useful resources and approaches for solving problems.
Track my own progress from zero to hero in DSA!
